# Overview

This project is a Flashcard App developed as a learning exercise to further my skills as a software engineer. The app allows users to create flashcards for studying purposes, view all flashcards, mark flashcards as favorites, and view favorite flashcards separately.

## Description

The Flashcard App is a simple Flutter application. Users can add new flashcards by providing a question and an answer. They can then view all flashcards and tap on a flashcard to toggle between showing the question and revealing the answer. Additionally, users can mark flashcards as favorites and view their favorite flashcards separately.

### Purpose

The purpose of creating this app is to gain hands-on experience with Flutter development, improve my understanding of state management in Flutter applications, and practice building a user interface with interactive elements.
